Additional Metrics Analysis
To better understand the campaign’s performance beyond conversion rate, I also compared several other metrics between the control and test groups.

Spend [USD]
The test group shows a slightly higher average spend compared to the control group. This might suggest that users in the test group are either more engaged or exposed to more expensive products. While the difference isn’t dramatic, it could be meaningful if supported by further data.

# of Website Clicks
Interestingly, the test group had more average website clicks than the control group. This indicates that users were interacting more with the site during the campaign, possibly showing greater interest or curiosity. However, this didn’t necessarily lead to higher conversions.

# of View Content
The control group performed slightly better in terms of content views. This might mean that although users in the test group clicked more, they didn’t engage as deeply with product pages. It could hint at differences in user journey quality between the groups.

# of Add to Cart
The control group had a higher average number of add-to-cart actions, which is quite surprising given the higher clicks from the test group. This could indicate a mismatch between user expectations and what they found, or perhaps friction in the purchase funnel in the test version.

# of Purchases
Purchases were very close between both groups, with the control group just slightly ahead. This aligns with the earlier conversion rate analysis, which showed no significant statistical difference.

Overall Observation
While the test group had more clicks and slightly higher spend, these didn’t translate into more conversions or purchases. In fact, the control group performed better in terms of engagement-related actions like add-to-cart and view content.
